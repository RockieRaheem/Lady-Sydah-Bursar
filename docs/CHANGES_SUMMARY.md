# 🎓 Enhanced Payment & Bursary System - Summary

## ✅ What's New

### 1. **Class-Based Fee Structure**

Each class now has a fixed termly fee that automatically applies to all pupils:

- Baby Class: UGX 200,000
- P.1-P.7: UGX 250,000 - 370,000 (increases with grade level)

### 2. **Dual Payment Tracking**

Every pupil now tracks:

- **Total Paid**: Sum of all payments received
- **Balance**: Remaining amount owed (positive = owes money, negative = overpaid)

### 3. **Comprehensive Bursary System**

Three types of financial aid:

- **None**: Full fee payment required
- **Partial**: Custom discount percentage (1-99%)
- **Full**: 100% scholarship, no payment required

### 4. **Bursary Documentation**

- Percentage discount field
- Reason for financial aid (required for Partial/Full)
- Common reasons: Single parent, sibling discount, orphan, sponsorship, hardship

### 5. **Automatic Fee Calculation**

System calculates:

```
Expected Fee = Base Class Fee - (Base Fee × Bursary %)
Balance = Expected Fee - Total Paid
```

### 6. **Visual Payment Status**

Four automatic statuses:

- ✅ **Paid**: Fully paid, balance = 0
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Some payment made
- ❌ **Pending**: No payment yet
- 💰 **Overpaid**: Paid more than expected

### 7. **Enhanced UI Elements**

- 🎁 Gift icon for bursary students
- Color-coded balances (red = owe, green = paid)
- Real-time fee calculation preview in dialogs
- Receipt number auto-generation

## 📊 Sample Data Updates

### Students on Bursaries:

1. **Ode Tambo** (P.3) - 50% partial, single parent
2. **Musa Traore** (P.6) - 75% partial, sibling + hardship
3. **Habiba Jalloh** (P.7) - 100% full, orphan/church sponsorship

## 🔄 Updated Components

### Files Modified:

1. **src/lib/data.ts** - Core data structure with new types
2. **src/lib/global-state.tsx** - Removed old balance calculation
3. **src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/payments/page.tsx** - New balance logic
4. **src/components/dashboard/AddEditPupilDialog.tsx** - Full rewrite with bursary UI
5. **src/components/dashboard/PupilsDataTable.tsx** - New columns and status badges
6. **src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/pupils/[pupilId]/page.tsx** - Enhanced detail view

### New Helper Functions:

- `calculateExpectedFee()` - Computes fee after bursary discount
- `getPaymentStatus()` - Determines Paid/Partial/Pending/Overpaid
- `getBursaryAmount()` - Calculates total discount amount
