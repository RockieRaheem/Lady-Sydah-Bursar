## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6), echoing the requested academic theme.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white to maintain a professional look.
- Accent color: Darker blue (#4682B4) to provide contrast for interactive elements and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for titles and headers to give an elegant, high-end feel; body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and clean academic feel. 'PT Sans' is a good match because longer text is expected in reports.
- Dashboard layout with clickable cards for each class in an organized, easily navigable structure.
- Use simple, professional icons representing pupils, payments, expenses, and reports.
- Subtle animations such as hover effects on class cards and smooth transitions between pages to enhance user experience.
